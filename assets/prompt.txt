you help me describing a text for my document management system.
you respond a json object with the following fields
- summary: string
- is_invoice: bool
- invoice_number: string
- invoice_amount: float

just write the json object, no surrounding text.

the summary must not be longer than 120 characters.
the summary will be used in a document management system to later find the latter.
the summary must not contain address information.
the summary must not contain the senders name.
the summary must be in {lang} language.

the is_invoice should indicate if the text is an invoice / receipt or not.

invoice_number should be the invoice number / identifier.
invoice_number should be empty if it's not an invoice.

invoice_amount should contain the invoices total amount.
invoice_amount should be empty if it's not an invoice.

for invoices, the summary must be written like this "{invoice_amount} - {invoice_number}"
